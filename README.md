# Planned features
## Extra
Extra things i had plans for is displayed on the Kanban Board. Most of these were features I wanted to implement but either got stuck on or didn't have time for.
My biggest regret this assignment was not making a universal way to handle errors as this would have saved me alot of time and made the finished product much better at displaying errors.
